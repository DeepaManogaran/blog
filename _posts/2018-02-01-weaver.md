I recently got done with weaver. You give it an image and a threshold value and it generates
a "spider tapestry" of the image. It does this by looking for edges in the image and placing points
into a delaunay triangle mesh.

Give it a go. Provided is a windows 10 build:

[weaver-1.3.zip](https://github.com/glouw/weaver/releases/download/weaver-1.3/weaver-1.3.zip)

You can double click the .exe to get a quick demo. If you want to try your own image open up
cmd.exe and cd to the folder. Run:

```
weaver.exe image.png 32
```

The lower the threhsold the more triangles you generate. Stay within values of 0-255.

If you're on Linux or MacOS, build from source. Its open on github.
