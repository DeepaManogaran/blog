Weaver generates a spider tapestry with a two fold algorithm. The initial phase
processes the image: The image is blurred with a Gaussian convolution blur,
grey scaled, and then sobel filtered. A threshold is then applied to identify
edges with a binary true or false. These points are pushed into list.

The latter phase makes use of Delaunay Triangulation:
A point from the list may freely be placed in a triangle mesh given that all triangles
do not contain the point within in their circumcenters. Fortunately this will
never be the case as the window is engulfed with a super-triangle.

![One triangle engulfs the entire window on the outside](/images/wv/1tri.png)

Given that the point does lie in a triangle's circumcenter, the triangle is
removed and its edges torn to form three new triangles with the point.

![Three Triangles](/images/wv/3tri.png)

Given the point is placed in the circumcenter of two or more triangles, the
triangles are removed and overlapping aligning edges of the triangles are also removed.

![Two Triangles](/images/wv/2tri.png)

The remaining edges are unique and are used to construct new triangles with the point.

![Four Triangles](/images/wv/4tri.png)

Triangle edges are painted with the pixel color value at the center of the triangle.

The iteration continues until all points have been added to the mesh.
