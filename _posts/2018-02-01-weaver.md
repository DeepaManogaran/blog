I recently finished a side-project I call Weaver.

![The White Wolf](/images/geralt.png)

Weaver generates a spider tapestry of your favorite image.
It does this by inserting points along prominent edges into a delaunay triangle mesh.
The edges of the triangles are then painted with the pixel value at the triangle center.

Give it a go. Here's a windows 10 build:

[weaver-1.3.zip](https://github.com/glouw/weaver/releases/download/weaver-1.3/weaver-1.3.zip)

Double click the .exe to get a quick demo. Try an image yourself; open cmd.exe,
cd to the folder, and run:

```
weaver.exe image.png 32
```

The number signifies the threshold value. Lower threhsolds
generate more triangles. Time complexity is exponential since every mesh triangle
must be checked before a new point is added to the mesh.

Accepted threshold values: [0-255].

If you're on Linux or MacOS it's probably easier to build from source.

Just pull and make:

You'll need SDL2 and SDL2_Image dependencies but most package managers
have strong support for these packages.
