To understand something as complex as the graphics pipeline one must reinvent it with a basic toolset.
I picked the N64 graphics pipeline for this exercise. It is not as complicated as modern day pipelines,
but the combination of z-buffering, Gouraud shading, and texture mapping yields some pretty nice results:

This can be done in about 500 lines of C code. One just needs a 32 bit pointer to video memory,
a strong understanding of linear algebra, and plenty of patience.

3D models are stored in wavefront object files. These object files contain a list of vertices and faces.
Faces are trigons composed of any three vertices. In addition to faces and vertices, object file contains
normal vertices for each vertex.

Faces are pushed to a list. Faces are centered around (0, 0, 0) and translated to fit the screen.

Faces are filled by wrapping a 2D rectangle around a trigon. For every pixel of the rectangle
the barycentric coordinate of the tirgon is calculated. If the x, y, and z coordinates of the barycentric
coordinate are all greater than zero then the x and y coordinate of the rectangle is within the trigon.

The amount of light reflected from a trigon is calculated using the dot product of the sum of the trigon vertice
normals with the direction of light from the camera.

Faces in the front may not overlap faces in the back. A Z-buffer keeps track of pixel distance from the viewport.

A perspective view is established by dividing the x and y coordinate of each vertex with the
corrosponding z value using (1.0 - z).

By reusing the previously calculated barycentric coordinate, a varying vertex of the trigon is calculated
with dot products of the normal vertices with the direction of light from the camera.

This technique is known as Gouraud shading.
