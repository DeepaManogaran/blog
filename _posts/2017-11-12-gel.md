To understand something as complex as the graphics pipeline one must reinvent it with a basic toolset.
I picked the N64 graphics pipeline for this exercise. It is not as complicated as modern day pipelines,
but the combination of z-buffering, Gouraud shading, and texture mapping yields some pretty nice results:

This can be done in about 500 lines of C code. One just needs a 32 bit pointer to video memory,
a strong understanding of linear algebra, and plenty of patience.

3D models are stored in wavefront object files. These object files contain a list of vertices and faces.
Faces are trigons composed of any three vertices.

Faces are pushed into a list. Faces are centered around (0, 0, 0) and translated to fit
the screen.

Faces are filled by wrapping a 2D rectangle around a trigon. For every pixel of the rectangle
the barycentric coordinates is calculated. If the x, y, and z coordinates of the barycentric
coordinate are all greater than zero then the point is within the trigon.

In addition to faces and vertices, the wavefront object file contains normal vertices
for each vertex. The amount of light reflected from a trigon can be calculated using
the dot product of the sum of the trigon vertice normals with the direction of light from the camera.

Faces in the front may not overlap faces in the back so a Z-buffer keeps track of pixel distance from the viewport.

A perspective view is established by dividing the x and y coordinate of each vertex with the
corrosponding z value using (1.0 - z).
