Did you know that vim has tabs built in?

    vim -p Theme.c Timer.c World.c

You'll get this:

![](/images/vim/2019-02-02-041150_681x248_scrot.png)

To switch between tabs use:

    gT
    gt

Or, for the inclined, add this to your .vimrc:

    set tabpagemax=128
    map <C-h> gT
    map <C-l> gt

And now you can switch between 128 open tabs with Ctrl + H and Ctrl + L.
