I am an experienced programmer who steers towards low level programming
concepts such as graphics engines, virtual machines, compilers,
machine learning, image processing, and video game development.

I studied Mechatronics Systems Engineering from Simon Fraser University to which
I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Science.

I have four years of engineering experience, some of which I spent in
class III medical devices and the heavy duty machinery industry. I most
recently worked as a firmware developer doing silicon validation for Intel.

Below are an archive of my writings. They're mainly about about my personal projects on my git:

If you have questions my contact info is at the bottom of the page - I am more than happy to help.
