I am an experienced programmer who steers towards low level programming
concepts such as graphics engines, virtual machines, compilers,
image processing, and video game development.

I have four years of engineering experience, some of which I spent in the
class III medical industry and heavy duty machinery industry.

I most recently worked as a C++ firmware programmer doing silicon validation for Intel.

I studied Mechatronics Systems Engineering from Simon Fraser University to which
I earned a bachelor's in applied science.
